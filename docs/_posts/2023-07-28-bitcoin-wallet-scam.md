## Prologue

It was an awesome sunny day like none other.

The birds were chirping, and sun was up high and no clouds in sight.
Me and my sisters husband David had some luck with the weather.  
We had a planned a _"Let's hang out on the balcony, talk and drink beers"_ day, even though all weather reports were pointing towards it being a cloudy day.  
If not for the pleasant semi-shade that a tree close to me was providing, I would certainly have looked like a red lobster the day after.

After having some great artisan pizza at the local pizza shop, we were walking back home, delighted and joyful as one could ever be on a summers day.  
Suddenly, David picked up a small zip-lock bag he found on the street - and asked me, _"What is this?"_

## We're gonna get rich?! ü§ë

I saw what it looked like, and I nabbed the bag out of Davids hand, and shoved the bag into my pocket - and said that we'll look at it in more detail once we get home.

I started to explain to David a bit about bitcoin, and that my initial though was that it could be connected to illicit activities and thus why we had to make haste away from the location.

Once at home, we opened the bag, and it contained two pieces of paper. Something that definitively looks like a [paper wallet](https://paperwallet.bitcoin.com/), and a separate paper that looked like a piece of printed receipt.

The receipt for a transaction of buying `0.52 BTC` at a value of about `14'000‚Ç¨`, and the other was the wallet of said `0.52 BTC` - with lots of fancy print and features on the paper, like a silver holographic "genuine" stamp.

## üëº Do the right thing, or split the loot? üòà

> _I will turn this in to the police_

Even if I could _somehow_ turn a profit, I knew that there was only one thing one can do with this find, turn it in.

1. _If_ the money is real, it is probably fraudulent or criminal money. i.e. morally I don't want anything to do with it.
2. The Swedish law: _"Lag (1938:121) om hittegods"_ - clearly states that lost property shall be turned in to the Police.
3. Just taking a photo of the paper, is enough to "steal" it, and it could just as well have already been used. But even then, it could be a missing piece needed for the police in some investigation.

Although, I assured David - that if I somehow would get money from this, certainly I would split half of it with him. As he was the one picking it up in the first place. We're family after all!

Either way, we were jokingly bantering about how to _split the money_ in the evening over some great American bourbon.

## To the police üëÆ

> üì±üì® Have you turned it in yet? // David

Leaving it to the police, was not as easy as I would have reckoned.

They have visiting hours, which was only during limited office hours, but even worse.

Of course they had limited my local police station no lot handle lost goods, probably due to summer vacations. üå¥

I wrote David a reply, that I have not - as the local station could not handle turn-ins right now, but I had to schedule another day - in combination of working from the consultant office in Stockholm.

### Second try üëÆ

> And that's what I did!

During lunch, when working remotely from the consultant office I took with me the bag to the police. 

Luckily there wasn't much of a queue and I got to speak with a police behind a big glass window. 

_"I have found this bag with something to claims to be bitcoins of a value of about 14 thousand euros"_ - I said as I slides the thin plastic zip-lock bag under to the police woman.

_"Oh, another one"_ she said quickly before going somewhere into their back-offices, _"I'll check with a colleague of mine"_.

She promptly came back, and declared that _"It's fake, I can either throw it away for you or you can keep it"_. I promoted for the second option of keeping it. And she gave it back to me.

## A convincing scam üôÇ

So it turns out to be a scam, which actually makes a lot of sense to me - as the odds of just finding a real one on the streets seemed a bit too strange and odd to me.

If one would be to follow the QR-codes they take you to a webpage üö© (it is supposed to just be an "digital address"), where they want to input the `Private key` üö© into a form on their webpage in order to "check your account" or "withdrawal the money". 

This is where the criminals would start to trick you, or maybe even the webpage that you get directed to could been compromised to do other nasty things with your computer. Although I don't know, since I haven't tried [scambaiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam_baiting) the process myself.

Like most scams, they try to play a persons feelings, in order for you to make irrational decisions. In this case probably a "get rich quick" scam.

Maybe they send over criminals to press you out of money? Maybe they try to "help" you getting the money (but instead taking your money)?   
I don't know the further details of this scam, but I would not be surprised if people have fallen for it. üôÅ   
As according to the police, they had gotten many of these turned in already - making it very plausible that some one has placed these bags all around Stockholm in order to find people that wouldn't turn the lost property in.

## Any moral of the story?

First and foremost. When in doubt, do the **right** thing.

And second, on a technical level. If someone or anything would need you to give _them_ the `Private key` to a bitcoin - it _is_ a scam.  
It makes a lot of sense to me - but certainly it would trick many people out there that maybe don't know bitcoin more than from it's name - and computers more than how to browse the web and post funny pictures.
