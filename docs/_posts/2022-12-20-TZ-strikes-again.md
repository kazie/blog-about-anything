title: Date & time bugs, strikes again. ðŸ˜±

## Foreword

You may have already heard it about me.
But I am someone who really have grown battle-worn from different times of bugs, originating around date-times.

Serialisation, the whole civil part about [`timezones`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone),
and sometimes even the fabric of time itself, always somehow seem to put a dent to my overall happiness.

Some day, I hope my talk that I am building around it may be spread and known - just to minimize the amount of these kinds of bugs that I really can live without.

## Just a normal weekend.

### VPN

### Buying tickets

### Time of the Live

#### Pain

### What was wrong?
