title: Date & time bugs, strikes again. 😱

## Foreword

You may have already heard it about me.
But I am someone who really have grown battle-worn from different times of bugs, originating around date-times.

Serialisation, the whole civil part about [`timezones`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone),
and sometimes even the fabric of time itself, always somehow seem to put a dent to my overall happiness.

Some day, I hope my talk that I am building around it may be spread and known - just to minimize the amount of these kinds of bugs that I really can live without.

## Just a normal weekend.

What do you like to do on weekends?

I guess most of us want to have a good time, and recharge our batteries, and that's what I was set to do.

On Sunday morning, I was going to see an [Japanese ライブ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96), a live show starring some live streamers from a franchise I really like.

It was their first live event, and I was really excited and happy - although I knew that I had to jump through a few hoops in order to see this show.
Because _of course_ the show itself is behind both a <u>paywall</u>, and is <u>region locked</u>.
And don't get me wrong, I have nothing against things being monetised - although it adds extra complexity for someone like me - a total foreigner.

### Region Locking 🕵️

One of the things I did mention, was the whole thing about _region locking_.

This is a well known problem, and has two well known solutions.

1) Move your arse to wherever you need to be.
2) Somehow pretend that you have moved your arse to wherever you need to be.

And when it comes to internet traffic, one could even route their traffic in such a way that the source/origin is in said countries.

One such tool is [`Tor`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)), which is used both for anonymity online, and can be a great tool to circumvent censorship and oppression.
But it may not be perfect for throughput, and if I want to watch a live-stream with video and sound - I chose to take another approach.

The other tool I am thinking of is `VPN`, which encrypts your traffic and exits from specific, often paid servers around the world.
These ones may be blocked though by streaming services, and I think many big operators are working around it by playing some kind of cat and mouse chaise. 🐭💨🐱

And when it comes to __VPN__, you can probably seen endless commercials from social media about some services, be it _fast_ or _north_ or some other kind of naming, they most have the same kind of business strategies.
Long term subscriptions, and huge deals, making you commit for them. One has to subscribe with an email address or other personal information, and probably gather and sell it themselves, since if you're using their service, they could just as well be as bad as they are trying to make your ISP out to be.

Although there is a Swedish company called [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/), that has their code open-source (thus making it easy for me to guess that it WILL work on LINUX), and have policies that speak to me.
No marketing or campaigning, just want to deliver a good service, which __could__ be anonymous. Although I hae heard that they do not play the cat-and-mouse game, so services like Netflix may have blocked their addresses.

### Buying tickets
